# Introduction.

Hello, I'm Larry, a passionate web developer and dedicated bookworm residing in Singapore. With a strong foundation in web development, I thrive on creating responsive, visually appealing websites that offer seamless user experiences. From conceptualizing ideas to implementing robust solutions, I enjoy the creative process and the challenge of solving problems through code.

## Web Development ðŸ’»

My journey in web development began in 2020. I specialize in front-end and back-end development, utilizing languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js. Whether it's crafting intuitive interfaces or optimizing site performance, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that exceed client expectations.

## Bookworm at Heart ðŸ“š

Beyond coding, I am a voracious reader with a deep appreciation for literature across genres. I find solace in the pages of a well-written book, exploring different worlds and perspectives. My favorite genres include biology and art, and I am always open to discovering new literary gems and engaging in thought-provoking discussions about books.

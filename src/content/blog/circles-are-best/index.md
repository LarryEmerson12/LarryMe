## Why do I choose them?

Okay. So the first thing you will ask is **why**? So, I always choose
circles becuse they are round and are easier to move. ( Test it below! )

<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer@1.9.2/build/spline-viewer.js"
></script>

<spline-viewer url="https://prod.spline.design/lWocFHeN3KsKYYTK/scene.splinecode"></spline-viewer>

Also, they can roll all over ( a funny way to walk ) and bounce ( whick is how they jump ).

## When do I use them?

I use them when designing my characters ( who are these blobs ). Circles are my main shape. I don't make everything a circle, but I try to round them if they cannot be a circle. ( Like this! )

<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@splinetool/viewer@1.9.2/build/spline-viewer.js"></script>
<spline-viewer url="https://prod.spline.design/kex9I4Ff3ZrSOvX3/scene.splinecode"></spline-viewer>

You see, the pencil has rounded corners. I just try to make everthing round.

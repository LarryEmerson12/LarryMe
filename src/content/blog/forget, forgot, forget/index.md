## Introduction

Most people forget to do some tasks in their lives. Whether its a boring task or not, we still forget sometimes. There are _many_ reasons.

## Why do we forget?

Most of the time, we forget because we are reluctant to do a task. Imagine your mother asks you to mop the whole floor. Would you feel reluctant to do it? Some yes and some no. _In this case_, you say yes. So you go to the living room and say _'wait...'_. You play some games, doodle and do other things.

| Level of reluctancy    | Going to do | Not going to do |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Strongly not reluctant | 80-100%     | 0-20%           |
| Not reluctant          | 60-80%      | 20-40%          |
| So-so                  | 40-60%      | 40-60%          |
| Reluctant              | 20-40%      | 60-80%          |
| Strongly reluctant     | 0-20%       | 80-100%         |

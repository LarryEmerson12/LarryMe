## Introduction

Most people forget to do some tasks in their lives. Whether its a boring task or not, we still forget sometimes. There are _many_ reasons. In this few chapters, we'll go through how we forget, why we forget and how do we solve that. Let's get started.

## The process of forgetting

We eventually forget something or an event is because the memory of it fades with time. If we do not attempt to look back at an event, the greater the interval time between the time when the event from happening and the time when we try to remember, the memory will start to fade. This is how we forget.

## Why do we forget?

Most of the time, we forget because we are reluctant to do a task. Imagine your mother asks you to mop the whole floor. Would you feel reluctant to do it? Some yes and some no. _In this case_, you say yes. So you go to the living room and say _'wait...'_. You play some games, doodle and do other things. That's when you forget.

| Level of reluctancy    | Going to do | Not going to do |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Strongly not reluctant | 80-100%     | 0-20%           |
| Not reluctant          | 60-80%      | 20-40%          |
| So-so                  | 40-60%      | 40-60%          |
| Reluctant              | 20-40%      | 60-80%          |
| Strongly reluctant     | 0-20%       | 80-100%         |

Another reason of forgetting is that you _just forget_. To fix that, we'll dive into the next chapter.

## How do we solve the problem?

1. Write a note.

To remember, the first thing you can do if you always forget to do tasks can be writing a note. Write a note where you can always see it. Do you always go online? If yes, than write it in a document where you usually go to. For example, I always go to the <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> app and write my notes. In this case, I can set a reminder in Obsidian to do a task I usually forget.

2. Make it fun

If the task you usually forget is very boring, make it **fun**. Otherwise, your motivation to do it will never go up. For example, when you are waiting in the clinic, you can listen to music or do things that you like to do.

3. Celebrate

You can motivate yourself by giving a small **gift** to yourself to celebrate. This increases your motivation. The more boring the task is, the bigger the celebration. This will help you remember it because you would want to recieve your celebration.

## Conclusion

Forgetting is a natural action that is performed by the brain. But, if you use it to absolve from your responsibility, it is an excuse. Use all the tips I have showed you, and everything will work well. Of course, if you use all of the three, it will be the best.

## Introduction

Back posture is important. It can affect your health, mood, and productivity. In this article, we will discuss how to improve your back posture.

## Why is back posture important?

Back posture is important because it affects your spine, muscles, and nerves. Good back posture can help prevent back pain, improve your mood, and increase your productivity. When you are young, you still have the opportunity to retrain your muscles and improve your posture. But, when you are older, your back posture is permanent. So, it is important to take care of your back posture now if you are still young.

## Types of bad back posture

There are many types of bad back posture. I will not be mentioning all in this list.

1. **Scoliosis**

   Scoliosis is a sideways curve of the spine. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic, environmental, and developmental.

3. **Kyphosis ( Hunchback )**

   Kyphosis is an outward curve of the upper back. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including aging, osteoporosis, and spinal cord injuries. Kyphosis can cause pain and affect your ability to move. The good news is that postural kyphosis can often be reversed through exercises that improve posture and strengthen the muscles in the upper back.

4. **Slouching**
   
   Slouching is the most common type of bad back posture. It is caused by sitting or standing with your back rounded forward. Slouching can cause pain in your back, neck, and shoulders. Slouching can also cause headaches, neck pain and other symptoms. Sometimes, you slouch because your bag is too heavy ( As shown below ).

## How to improve your back posture

Here's some tips on how to improve your back posture and make it straight:

- When you are using your phone, laptop or other device, position your **eye level** at the screen. This will bring your head up and not down. It also prevents neck pain.

- Sit straight. Prevent yourself from slouching or sliding to the side. Position it at a **0 degree angle**.

- When you are sitting, keep your feet flat on the floor. If you are to short, use a footrest.

- Set a timer for every **5 minutes** to sit straighter. Soon it will trigger a habit and you can **stop** using the timer.

- When you are standing, keep your shoulders back and your chest up.

- Stand up after long uses of your device.

- If your chair has no smooth surface, use a **boster**, **pillow** or **chair pad** to support your bag.

- Balance the weight you carry evenly.

- Take a boster or whatever that is a cylinder and put it under your backbone. Do this while lying down for 15 seconds and then come back up.

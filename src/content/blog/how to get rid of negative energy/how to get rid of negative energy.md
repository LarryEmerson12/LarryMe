## Understanding Negative Energy

While negative energy cannot be measured scientifically, most of us have experienced its effects. It can come from people, environments, or even our own thoughts. Negative energy **affects** you and others, often leading to a cycle that produces even more negativity. In this post, we'll explore how to deal with and stop negative energy.

## Sources of Negative Energy

Let’s examine some common sources of negativity. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it highlights major contributors.

1. **Negative people**

Most sources of negativity come from human behavior, and we all experience negativity at times. Often, when we dislike something, we **complain** (one example of negative energy). For example, you go to a country for a holiday and the weather is hot. Some people might complain, "Oh my god! This place is burning!" This reaction is not only negative but can also be disrespectful to the locals.

2. **Negative environment**

Negative energy can also stem from your surroundings. For instance, if you are in a room with people arguing, you will likely feel the tension and negativity in the atmosphere.

3. **Negative self-talk**

Negative self-talk is a frequent source of negativity. When people are unhappy with themselves, they often speak harshly to themselves. For example, "I am so stupid!" or "I am so ugly!" These thoughts reflect a harmful pattern of negative self-talk.

## 3 Ways to Get Rid of Negative Energy

Let's explore some techniques to dispel negative vibes.

> Don't let negative and toxic people rent space in your head. Raise the rent and kick them out.

1. **Positive self-talk**

Positive self-talk is the antidote to negative self-talk. When you're feeling down about yourself, try to replace negative thoughts with affirmations like, "I am smart!" or "I am capable!" This shift in mindset can boost your self-esteem and create a more positive outlook.

2. **Positive environment**

Just as a negative environment can drain your energy, a positive one can rejuvenate you. When you find yourself in a toxic setting, seek out spaces that uplift you. This could be a park, a library, or any place where you feel calm and happy.

3. **Positive people**

Surrounding yourself with positive people can significantly improve your mood and outlook. Look for friends or acquaintances who bring joy, encouragement, and positivity into your life. They can help you stay focused on the bright side and inspire you to be your best self.

## Conclusion

By addressing these sources of negativity and adopting positive strategies, you can take control of your energy and improve both your mindset and your surroundings. Through conscious effort, it’s possible to create a more uplifting environment that fosters well-being and happiness.

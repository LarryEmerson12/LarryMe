## What are tenses?

A tense is a period which a action ( verb ) could have happened. Tenses can be divided into 12 groups. The **main** tenses are: **Past tense**, **Present tense** and **Future tense**.

## Level 1

We'll going to learn about the _main_ tenses in level 1. Let's get into it.
As you know, the main tenses are: **Past tense**, **Present tense** and **Future tense**.
Let's see how to use them:

| Past                                     | Present                                  | Future                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| actions that happened before this moment | actions that are happening at the moment | actions that will happen after this moment |
| I <u>ate</u>.                            | I <u>eat</u>.                            | I <u>will eat</u>.                         |

Do you realise that in the past, we use the past form of the verb, in the present we use the present form of the verb and in the future we add the 'will' to the front of the present form of the verb? 

| Past | Present | Future                 |
| ---- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| ate  | eat     | will + present form ( eat ) |
